Push-notifications ads network
Launched in december 2020
Middleman between advertisers and publishers

How does it work?
Clients install a module
Outpush send personalised ads to the client users
1 click = money for the client

# 2. Problem statement

Subscribers receive same notifications multiple times: is it usefull?

Challenges of this project:

  * Understand how do repeated impressions affect users ‘Click Through Rate’ over time
  * Perform statistical analysis

*‘Click Through Rate’ = Number of clicks on Ads / Number of impressions of the Ads

# 3. Insights and recomendations
* Boost the notification push during the time periods with higher subscribers activity
   Wednesdays the higher 'Click Through Rate' of the week
   Saturdays the lower 'Click Through Rate' of the week
   Between 09:00 AM and 11:00 AM the higher 'Click Through Rate' of the day

* Subscribers “Interest retention” plan.  
   A subscriber “interest retention” plan could help to boost the Ads 'Opened Rate' for longer time subscribed users.
